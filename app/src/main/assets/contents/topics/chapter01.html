        Salatul Fatih (Arabic: صلاة الفاتح; Prayer of the Opener), commonly known as Durood Fatih in
        the
        subcontinent and Sholawat Fatih in Far East Asia was transmitted by the eminent gnostic and
        scholar Abu al-Makarim Shaykh Muhammad Shams al-Din ibn Abi al-Hasan al-Bakri. He was a
        descendent of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, from whom he inherited the station of supreme truthfulness
        (al-Siddiqiyya) and attained the loftiest reaches of mastery in the mystical divine
        sciences. It
        is said to have been revealed by Allah to him upon a piece of paper. It is also attributed
        to
        Shaykh Ahmad Tijani, the founder of the Tijaniyya Sufi order. The prayer is recited by
        millions
        of Tijaniyya adherents across the world as part of their daily wird.

    According to some, each “āh” in الله should extend for approximately 12 counts.

    <br>O Allah, send prayers upon the one from whom the spiritual secrets were sundered, and
    from
    whom the lights burst forth, and in whom the ultimate realities arose.
    <br><br>
    The one in whom descended the knowledge of Adam and thus stymied all of creation, and before
    whom all understandings dwindled, thus none of us before or after has ever realised his true
    essence and none of us ever will.
    <br><br>
    The gardens of the dominion (malakut) are fair with the flowering of his resplendent beauty,
    and
    the pools of the omnipotence (jabarut) pour forth through his ever-flowing illuminations.
    <br><br>
    And there is nothing except that it is conditioned by him, since if not for the means, the
    end —
    as has been said — would have gone.
    <br><br>
    Send upon him such a prayer that truly befits You — from You unto him as is deserving to
    him.
    <br><br>
    O Allah, indeed, he is Your all-embracing secret, the guide unto You, and Your Supreme
    Sentinel
    standing for You, before You.
    <br><br>
    O Allah! Connect me with his lineage, realise me through his excellence, grant me knowledge
    of
    him — knowledge through which I attain salvation from the streams of ignorance, and by which
    I
    may sip from the streams of bounty.
    <br><br>
    And carry me on his path unto Your Divine Presence — with a carrying surrounded by Your aid.
    <br><br>
    And hurl me against falsehood so I smash it, and plunge me into the seas of Absolute
    Oneness,
    and pluck me from the mires of affirming unity, and drown me in the centre of the sea of
    oneness
    until I neither see nor hear nor find nor sense anything but by it.
    <br><br>
    O Allah! Make the Supreme Sentinel the life of my spirit, and make his spirit the secret of
    my
    reality, and make his reality the connector of my realms, by the realisation of the first
    truth.
    <br><br>
    O First! O Last! O Outward! O Inward!
    <br><br>
    Hear my plea as You heard the plea of Your servant Zakariyya.
    <br><br>
    And grant me victory through You and for You, and aid me through You and for You, and join
    me
    and You, and come between me and other than You.
    <br><br>
    Allah, Allah, Allah!
    <br><br>
    Surely, the (Lord) Who has enjoined (the teaching, preaching and establishment of the system
    given in) the Qur’an upon you will bring you back (according to your desire) to the place of
    return (Mecca or the Hereafter with victory and success). Say: ‘My Lord knows best the one
    who
    brought guidance and (also) the one who is in open error.’* [* This Verse was revealed at
    Hajfa
    whilst migrating from Mecca on the way to Medina. This promise was fulfilled on the day of
    the
    Meccan Victory.] (28:85)
    <br><br>
    (Call to mind the time) when a few youths took refuge in the cave. They sid: ‘O our Lord,
    bestow
    upon us mercy from Your presence and provide (means of) guidance in our affair.’ (18:10)
    <br><br>
    Surely, Allah and (all) His angels send blessings and greetings on the Holy Prophet
    (blessings
    and peace be upon him). O believers! Invoke blessings on him and salute him with a worthy
    salutation of peace abundantly (and fervently). (33:56)
